# Simulation-Model-of-Hydrogen-Fueling

1. Unzip the property models file and place it in the same folder as the code file.
2. Conduct simulation under base conditions through execution code.
3. Conduct simulation changing the variables in the execution code.
4. Conduct optimization(bayes-opt) for n-bank models.
